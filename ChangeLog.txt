March 3, 2017:
- Created changelog file
    All changes priour to this will not be documented
    
- Set up air piston system for first tests
    Will not commence testing until I get a proper air compressor (the one I planned to use nearly exploded during a test run)


March 4, 2017:
- Got more parts for the air piston system
    It now has two working pistons and solenoid valves, but they were out of stock, so I will finish when they have more
    
- Testd how much weight was needed to press the dance pad tiles
    It takes about 14 pounds to trigger it, much less than the pistons can push


March 5, 2017
- Measured, cut, and assembled the body that will sit over the pad


March 7, 2017
- Trimmed two legs that were slightly too big
- Measured and marked the piston mounting location on the body

March 9, 2017
- Attached one piston and valve to the body with proper tubing

March 11, 2017
- 3 of 4 pistons attached (the last one is yet to come in)
- 2 of 4 valves attached (two yet to come in)

March 12, 2017
- Got final piston and attached it to the body
- Got final two valves and wired one of them
    -I had to bite the bullet on this and buy the more expensive 5 way 3 position valves. Oh well
    -I cut my hand while stripping the wires, and am going heal before wiring the second valve
- Still need two more brass silencers and two more connecters.  Almoast ready for the arduino connection test

March 13, 2017
- Wired and installed the two new valves
- Preformed a base test and checked for air leaks
    -Discovered no leaks and all pistons and valves work great
- Will preform a human controlled game test to measure pressure and lag of the pistons
- Version 2.0 is almoast complete!

March 16, 2017
- Having trouble getting the transistors to work
    -Still have not got one working.
-Taped pins to the bare wire to allow breadboarding
    -Will solder when I get access to an iron
 
 March 19, 2017
 - Soldered pins to all the wires
