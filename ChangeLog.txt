March 3, 2017:
- Created changelog file
    All changes priour to this will not be documented
    
- Set up air piston system for first tests
    Will not commence testing until I get a proper air compressor (the one I planned to use nearly exploded during a test run)


March 4, 2017:
- Got more parts for the air piston system
    It now has two working pistons and solenoid valves, but they were out of stock, so I will finish when they have more
    
- Testd how much weight was needed to press the dance pad tiles
    It takes about 14 pounds to trigger it, much less than the pistons can push


March 5, 2017
- Measured, cut, and assembled the body that will sit over the pad


March 7, 2017
- Trimmed two legs that were slightly too big
- Measured and marked the piston mounting location on the body
